#### This Project is meant to identify and recognize emotions in a given image.

# Plan of Action and flow of activities 

**Step1: Image pre processing to convert JPEG images to tensforflow record data**
[example image conversion tool](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/inception/inception/data/build_image_data.py)

**Step2: Feature Engineering**
Identify the appropriate features and organise the input for Training set, Validation set and Test set.

**Step3: prepare and arrange computational requirments.**

**Step4: Model development**
Build YOLO or an LSTM model, using Keras and PyTorch/TensorFlow.

**Step5: Train the Model with the Training set.**

**Step6: Validate the accuracy and performance, measure precision ad recall.**

**Step7: Fine tune Hyper Parameters.**

**Step8: Test the model with Test set.**

**Step9: Move to Production by hooking up this application to real Yaga data and feed the insights back to Yaga for decision making and Yaga action.**
