####This Project is meant to identify and recognize emotions in a given image.

#Plan of Action and flow of activities 

**Step1: Image pre processing to convert JPEG images to tensforflow record data**
[example image conversion tool]
(https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/inception/inception/data/build_image_data.py)

**step2: Feature Engineering**
Identify the appropriate features and organise the input for Training set, Validation set and Test set.

**step3: prepare and arrange computational requirments.**

**step4: Model development**
Build YOLO or an LSTM model, using Keras and PyTorch/TensorFlow.

**step5: Train the Model with the Training set.**

**step6: Validate the accuracy and performance, measure precision ad recall.**

**step7: Fine tune Hyper Parameters.**

**step8: Test the model with Test set.**

**step9: Move to Production by hooking up this application to real Yaga data and feed the insights back to Yaga for decision making and Yaga action.**
